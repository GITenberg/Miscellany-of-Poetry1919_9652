<h2><a name="introduction">Prefatory Note</a></h2>
<br>
This <i>Miscellany of Poetry, 1919</i>, is issued to the public as a
truly catholic anthology of contemporary poetry. The poems here printed
are new, in the sense that they have not previously been issued by their
authors in book form &mdash; a fact which surely gives the <i>Miscellany</i> an unique
place among modern collections. My deep thanks are due to my
fellow-contributors for their generous and hearty co-operation, and to
the editors of the <i>English Review, To-day, Voices, New Witness,
Observer, Saturday Westminster, Art and Letters, Cambridge Magazine</i>
and the <i>Nation</i> for permission to reprint certain poems.<br>

<h3><i>Song</i></h3><br>

<blockquote>For Mercy, Courage, Kindness, Mirth,<br>
There is no measure upon earth.<br>
Nay, they wither, root and stem,<br>
If an end be set to them.<br><br>

Overbrim and overflow,<br>
If your own heart you would know;<br>
For the spirit born to bless<br>
Lives but in its own excess.</blockquote><br>

<a name="bincomm"></a><h3>Commercial</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>Gross, with protruding ears,<br>
Sleek hair, brisk glance, fleshy and yet alert,<br>
Red, full, and satisfied,<br>
Cased in obtuseness confident not to be hurt,<br><br>

He sits at a little table<br>
In the crowded congenial glare and noise, jingling<br>
Coin in his pocket; sips<br>
His glass, with hard eye impudently singling<br><br>

A woman here and there: &mdash; <br>
Women and men, they are all priced in his thought,<br>
All commodities staked<br>
In the market, sooner or later sold and bought.<br><br>

"Were I he," you are thinking,<br>
You with the dreamer's forehead and pure eyes,<br>
"What should I lose? &mdash; All,<br>
All that is worthy the striving for, all my prize,<br><br>

"All the truth of me, all<br>
Life that is wonder, pity, and fear, requiring<br>
Utter joy, utter pain,<br>
From the heart that the infinite hurts with deep desiring<br><br>

"Why is it I am not he?<br>
Chance? The grace of God? The mystery's plan?<br>
He, too, is human stuff,<br>
A kneading of the old, brotherly slime of man.<br><br>

"Am I a lover of men,<br>
And turn abhorring as from fat slug or snake?   <br>
Lives obstinate in me too<br>
Something the power of angels could not unmake?"<br><br>

O self-questioner! None<br>
Unlocks your answer. Steadily look, nor flinch.<br>
This belongs to your kind,<br>
And knows its aim and fails not itself at a pinch.<br><br>

It is here in the world and works,<br>
Not done with yet. &mdash; Up, then, let the test be tried!<br>
Dare your uttermost, be<br>
Completely, and of your own, like him, be justified.</blockquote>

<a name="binnum"></a><h3>Numbers</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>Trefoil and Quatrefoil!<br>
What shaped those destinied small silent leaves<br>
Or numbered them under the soil?<br>
I lift my dazzled sight<br>
From grass to sky,<br>
From humming and hot perfume<br>
To scorching, quivering light,<br>
Empty blue! &mdash; Why,<br>
As I bury my face afresh<br>
In a sunshot vivid gloom &mdash; <br>
Minute infinity's mesh,<br>
Where spearing side by side<br>
Smooth stalk and furred uplift<br>
Their luminous green secrets from the grass,<br>
Tower to a bud and delicately divide &mdash; <br>
Do I think of the things unthought<br>
Before man was?<br><br>

Bodiless Numbers!<br>
When there was none to explore<br>
Your winding labyrinths occult,<br>
None to delve your ore<br>
Of strange virtue, or do<br>
Your magical business, you<br>
Were there, never old nor new,<br>
Veined in the world and alive: &mdash; <br>
Before the Planets, Seven;<br>
Before these fingers, Five!<br><br>

You that are globed and single,<br>
Crystal virgins, and you that part,           <br>
Melt, and again mingle!              <br>
We have hoisted sail in the night           <br>
On the oceans that you chart:<br>
Dark winds carry us onward, on;         <br>
But you are there before us, silent Answers,<br>
Beyond the bounds of the sun.<br>
You body yourselves in the stars, inscrutable dancers,<br>
Native where we are none.<br><br>

O inhuman Numbers!<br>
All things change and glide,<br>
Corrupt and crumble, suffer wreck and decay,<br>
But, obstinate dark Integrities, you abide,<br>
And obey but them who obey.<br>
All things else are dyed<br>
In the colours of man's desire:<br>
But you no bribe nor prayer<br>
Avails to soften or sway.<br>
Nothing of me you share,<br>
Yet I cannot think you away.<br>
And if I seek to escape you, still you are there<br>
Stronger than caging pillars of iron<br>
Not to be passed, in an air<br>
Where human wish and word<br>
Fall like a frozen bird.<br><br>

Music asleep<br>
In pulses of sound, in the waves!<br>
Hidden runes rubbed bright!<br>
Dizzy ladders of thought in the night!<br>
Are you masters or slaves &mdash; <br>
Subtlest of man's slaves, &mdash; <br>
Shadowy Numbers?<br><br>

In a vision I saw<br>
Old vulture Time, feeding<br>
On the flesh of the world; I saw<br>
The home of our use undated &mdash; <br>
Seasons of fruiting and seeding<br>
Withered, and hunger and thirst<br>
Dead, with all they fed on:<br>
Till at last, when Time was sated,<br>
Only you persisted,<br>
Dædal Numbers, sole and same,<br>
Invisible skeleton frame<br>
Of the peopled earth we tread on &mdash; <br>
Last, as first.<br><br>

Because naught can avail<br>
To wound or to tarnish you;<br>
Because you are neither sold nor bought,<br>
Because you have not the power to fail<br>
But live beyond our furthest thought,<br>
Strange Numbers, of infinite clue,<br>
Beyond fear, beyond ruth,<br>
You strengthen also me<br>
To be in my own truth.</blockquote>

<a name="binchild"></a><h3>The Children Dancing</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>Away, sad thoughts, and teasing<br>
Perplexities, away!<br>
Let other blood go freezing,<br>
We will be wise and gay;<br>
For here is all heart-easing,<br>
An ecstasy at play!<br><br>

The children dancing, dancing,<br>
Light upon happy feet,<br>
Both eye and heart entrancing,<br>
Mingle, escape, and meet,<br>
Come joyous-eyed advancing<br>
And floatingly retreat.<br><br>

Now slow, now swifter treading<br>
Their paces timed and true,<br>
An instant poised, then threading<br>
A maze of printless clue,<br>
The music smoothly wedding<br>
To motions ever new.<br><br>

They launch in chime, and scatter<br>
In looping ripples; they<br>
Are Music's airy matter,<br>
And their feet move, the way<br>
The raindrops shine and patter<br>
On tossing flowers in May.<br><br>

As if those flowers were singing<br>
For joy of the bright air,<br>
As if you saw them springing<br>
To dance the breeze &mdash; so fair<br>
The lissom bodies swinging,<br>
So light the flung-back hair.<br><br>

And through the mind enchanted<br>
A happy river goes,<br>
By its own young carol haunted<br>
And bringing, where it flows,<br>
What all the world has wanted<br>
But who in this world knows?</blockquote>

<h3>A Farewell to Mathematics</h3><br>


<blockquote>I laboured on the anvil of my brain<br>
And beat a metal out of pageantry.<br>
Figure and form I carry in my train<br>
To load the scaffolds of Eternity.<br>
  Where the masters are<br>
  Building star on star;<br>
  Where, in solemn ritual,<br>
  The great Dead Mathematical<br>
  Wait and wait and wait for me.<br><br>

To the deliberate presence of the Sun<br>
(Bright cynosure of every darkling sign,<br>
Wherein all numbers consummate in One,)<br>
Poised on the bolt of an Un-finite line,<br>
  As one whose spirit's state,<br>
  Is unafraid but desperate,<br>
  Through far unfathomed fears,<br>
  Through Time to timeless years,<br>
  I soar, through Shade to Shine.<br><br>

They say that on a night there came to Euler,<br>
As eager-eyed he stared upon a star,<br>
And fought the far infinitude, a toiler<br>
Like to himself and me, for things that are<br>
  Buried from the eyes alone<br>
  Of men whose sight is made of stone,<br>
  And led him out in ecstasy,<br>
  Over the dim boundary<br>
  By the pale gleam of a scimitar.<br><br>

Then Euler, mindful of thy lesser need,<br>
Be thou my pilot in this treacherous hour,<br>
That I be less unworth thy greater meed,<br>
O my strong brother in the halls of power;<br>
  For here and hence I sail<br>
  Alone beyond the pale.<br>
  Where square and circle coincide,<br>
  And the parallels collide,<br>
  And perfect pyramids flower.</blockquote>

<a name="branret"></a><h3>Return</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>The hearts of the mountains were void,<br>
The sea spake foreign tongues,<br>
From the speed of the wind I gat me no breath,<br>
And the temples of Time were as sepulchres.<br>
I walked about the world in the midnight,<br>
I stood under water, and over stars,<br>
I cast Life from me,<br>
I handled Death,<br>
I walked naked into lightning,<br>
I had so great a thirst for God.<br><br>

       *       *       *       *       *<br><br>

       <br>
The heart of the Mountain overfloweth,<br>
The sea speaketh clear words,<br>
The Ark is brought to the Tabernacle.<br>
Lightnings, that withered in the sky,<br>
Are become great beacons roaring in a wind<br>
I see Death, lying in the arms of Life,<br>
And, in the womb of Death, I see Joy.<br>
I had said 'The spirit of the Earth is white,<br>
But lo! He is red with joy.<br>
He devoureth the meat of many nations,<br>
He absorbeth a vintage of scarlet.<br>
Though my head be with the stars,<br>
All the flowers of Earth are singing in mine ears.<br>
Though my foot be planted on the sea-bed.<br>
Yet is it shod with the thunder.<br>
Sorrow for Earth Transient is passed away,<br>
Pain of martyr'd splendour is no more.<br>
They have left a fair child in my lap &mdash; <br>
A lusty infant shouting to the dawn.<br><br>

The Ogre of midnight hath perished.<br>
He shivered in the glare of the mountain,<br>
He screamed upon the sea-swords,<br>
His bowels rushed out upon the lances of the Wind.<br>
I shall look through the eye of Mountain,<br>
I shall set in my scabbard the sabre of Sea,<br>
And the spear of Wind shall be my hand's delight.<br>
I shall not descend from the Hill.<br>
Never go down to the Valley;<br>
    For I see, on a snow-crowned peak,<br>
    The glory of the Lord,<br>
    Erect as Orion,<br>
    Belted as to his blade.<br>
But the roots of the mountains mingle with mist.<br>
And raving skeletons run thereon.<br>
    I shall not go hence,<br>
    For here is my Priest,<br>
Who hath broken me in the waters of Disdain.<br>
    Here is my Jester,<br>
Who hath mended me on the wheels of Mirth.<br>
    Here is my Champion,<br>
Who hath confounded mine ancient Enemy<br>
    Ardgay &mdash; the slayer of Giants.</blockquote>

<a name="brandead"></a><h3>Over the Dead</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>Who in the splendour of a simple thought,<br>
Whether for England or her enemies,<br>
Went in the night, and in the morning died;<br>
Each bleeding piece of human earth that lies<br>
Stark to the carrion wind, and groaning cries<br>
For burial &mdash; each Jesu crucified &mdash; <br>
Hath surely won the thing he dearly bought,<br>
For wrong is right, when wrong is greatly wrought.<br><br>

Yet is the Nazarene no thigh of Thor,<br>
To play on partial fields the puppet king<br>
Bearing the battle down with bloody hand.<br>
Serene he towers above the gods of war,<br>
A naked man where shells go thundering &mdash; <br>
The great unchallenged Lord of No-Man's Land.</blockquote>

<a name="chestball"></a><h3>The Ballad of St. Barbara</h3><br>

<i>(St. Barbara is the patroness of artillery, and of those who are in
fear of sudden death.)</i><br>
<br>
<blockquote>When the long grey lines came flooding upon Paris in the plain,<br>
We stood and drank of the last free air we never could love again;<br>
They had led us back from a lost battle, to halt we knew not where,<br>
And stilled us; and our gaping guns were dumb with our despair.<br>
The grey tribes flowed for ever from the infinite lifeless lands,<br>
And a Norman to a Breton spoke, his chin upon his hands:<br><br>

"There was an end to Ilium; and an end came to Rome;<br>
And a man plays on a painted stage in the land that he calls home.<br>
Arch after arch of triumph, but floor beyond falling floor,<br>
That lead to a low door at last: and beyond there is no door."<br><br>

The Breton to the Norman spoke, like a little child spake he,<br>
But his sea-blue eyes were empty as his home beside the sea:<br>
"There are more windows in one house than there are eyes to see;<br>
There are more doors in a man's house, but God has hid the key;<br>
Ruin is a builder of windows; her legend witnesseth<br>
Barbara, the saint of gunners, and a stay in sudden death."<br><br>

It seemed the wheel of the worlds stood still an instant in its turning,<br>
  More than the kings of the earth that turned with the turning of Valmy mill,<br>
While trickled the idle tale and the sea-blue eyes were burning,<br>
  Still as the heart of a whirlwind, the heart of the world stood still.<br><br>

"Barbara the beautiful had praise of lute and pen,<br>
Her hair was like a summer night, dark and desired of men,<br>
Her feet like birds from far away that linger and light in doubt,<br>
And her face was like a window where a man's first love looked out.<br><br>

"Her sire was master of many slaves, a hard man of his hands;<br>
They built a tower about her in the desolate golden lands,<br>
Sealed as the tyrants sealed their tombs, planned with an ancient plan,<br>
And set two windows in the tower, like the two eyes of a man."<br><br>

Our guns were set towards the foe; we had no word for firing;<br>
  Grey in the gateways of St. Gond the Guard of the tyrant shone;<br>
Dark with the fate of a falling star, retiring and retiring,<br>
  The Breton line went backwards and the Breton tale went on.<br><br>

"Her father had sailed across the sea from the harbour of Africa,                <br>
When all the slaves took up their tools for the bidding of Barbara;<br>
She smote the bare wall with her hand, and bade them smite again,<br>
She poured them wealth of wine and meat to stay them in their pain,<br>
And cried through the lifted thunder of thronging hammer and hod:<br>
'Throw open the third window in the third name of God!'<br>
Then the hearts failed and the tools fell; and far towards the foam<br>
Men saw a shadow on the sands; and her father coming home."<br><br>

  Speak low and low, along the line the whispered word is flying,<br>
  Before the touch, before the time, we may not lose a breath.<br>
  Their guns must mash us to the mire and there be no replying<br>
  Till the hand is raised to fling us for the final dice to Death.<br><br>

"'There were two windows in your tower, Barbara, Barbara,<br>
For all between the sun and moon in the lands of Africa.<br>
Hath a man three eyes, Barbara, a bird three wings,<br>
That you have riven roof and wall to look upon vain things?'<br>
Her voice was like a wandering thing that falters, yet is free,<br>
Whose soul has drunk in a distant land of the rivers of liberty.<br><br>

  There are more wings than the wind knows, or eyes than see the sun,<br>
In the light of the lost window and the wind of the doors undone;<br>
For out of the first lattice are the red lands that break<br>
And out of the second lattice, sea like a green snake,<br>
But out of the third lattice, under low eaves like wings<br>
Is a new corner of the sky and the other side of things.'"<br><br>

It opened in the inmost place an instant beyond uttering,<br>
  A casement and a chasm and a thunder of doors undone,<br>
A seraph's strong wing shaken out the shock of its unshuttering<br>
  That split the shattered sunlight from a light behind the sun.<br><br>

  "Then he drew sword and drave her where the judges sat and said:<br>
'Cæsar sits above the Gods, Barbara the maid,<br>
Cæsar hath made a treaty with the moon and with the sun<br>
All the gods that men can praise, praise him every one.<br>
There is peace with the anointed of the scarlet oils of Bel,<br>
With the Fish God, where the whirlpool is a winding stair to hell,<br>
With the pathless pyramids of slime, where the mitred negro lifts<br>
To his black cherub in the cloud abominable gifts,<br>
With the leprous silver cities where the dumb priests dance and nod,<br>
But not with the three windows and the last name of God.'"<br><br>

  They are firing, we are falling, and the red skies rend and shiver us ...           <br>
  Barbara, Barbara, we may not loose a breath &mdash;   <br>
  Be at the bursting doors of doom, and in the dark deliver us,<br>
  Who loosen the last window on the sun of sudden death.<br><br>

"Barbara, the beautiful, stood up as a queen set free.<br>
Whose mouth is set to a terrible cup and the trumpet of liberty;<br>
'I have looked forth from a window that no man now shall bar,<br>
Cæsar's toppling battle towers shall never stretch so far;<br>
The slaves are dancing in their chains, the child laughs at the rod,<br>
Because of the bird of the three wings, and the third face of God.'<br>
The sword upon his shoulder shifted and shone and fell,<br>
And Barbara lay very small and crumpled like a shell."<br><br>

  What wall upon what hinges turned stands open like a door?<br>
  Too simple for the sight of faith, too huge for human eyes,<br>
  What light upon what ancient way shines to a far off floor,<br>
  The line of the lost land of France or the plains of Paradise?<br><br>

"Cæsar smiled above the gods, his lip of stone was curled,<br>
His iron armies wound like chains round and round the world.<br>
And the strong slayer of his own that cut down flesh for grass,<br>
Smiled, too, and went to his own tower like a walking tower of brass,<br>
And the songs ceased and the slaves were dumb: and far towards the foam<br>
Men saw a shadow on the sands; and her father coming home....<br><br>

"Blood of his blood upon the sword stood red but never dry,<br>
He wiped it slowly, till the blade was blue as the blue sky:<br>
But the blue sky split with a thunder-crack, spat down a blinding brand,<br>
And all of him lay back and flat as his shadow on the sand."<br><br>

The touch and the tornado; all our guns give tongue together,<br>
St. Barbara for the gunnery and God defend the right &mdash; <br>
They are stopped and gapped and battered as we blast away the weather,<br>
Building window upon window to our lady of the light;<br>
For the light is come on Liberty, her foes are falling, falling,<br>
They are reeling, they are running, as the shameful years have run,<br>
She is risen for all the humble, she has heard the conquered calling,<br>
St. Barbara of the Gunners, with her hand upon the gun.<br><br>

They are burst asunder in the midst that eat of their own flatteries,<br>
Whose lip is curled to order as its barbered hair is curled ...<br>
 &mdash; Blast of the beauty of sudden death, St. Barbara of the batteries!<br>
That blew the new white window in the wall of all the world.<br><br>

For the hand is raised behind us, and the bolt smites hard<br>
Through the rending of the doorways, through the death-gap of the Guard,             <br>
For the shout of the Three Colours is in Condé and beyond,<br>
And the Guard is flung for carrion in the graveyard of St. Gond;<br>
Through Mondemont and out of it, through Morin marsh and on,<br>
With earthquake of salutation the impossible thing is gone;<br>
Gaul, charioted and charging, great Gaul upon a gun,<br>
Tiptoe on all her thousand years, and trumpeting to the sun,<br>
As day returns, as death returns, swung backward for a span,<br>
Back on the barbarous reign returns the battering-ram of Man.<br><br>

While that the east held hard and hot like pincers in a forge,<br>
Came like the west wind roaring up the cannon of St. George,<br>
Where the hunt is up and racing over stream and swamp and tarn,<br>
And their batteries, black with battle, hold the bridge-heads of the Marne;<br>
And across the carnage of the Guard by Paris in the plain<br>
The Normans to the Bretons cried; and the Bretons cheered again;<br>
But he that told the tale went home to his house beside the sea<br>
And burned before St. Barbara, the light of the windows three.<br>
Three candles for an unknown thing, never to come again,<br>
That opened like the eye of God on Paris in the plain.</blockquote>

<h3>Psyche Goes Forth to Life</h3><br>

<blockquote>What are these tears of loneliness to-night?<br>
Hark! In my neighbour's house the music swells,<br>
Joins with the wind and fills the empty skies<br>
And dies away, like echo of old age<br>
Sighing and dying in the heart that fails.<br>
Ah! the cruel beauty ... how it creeps<br>
Into my home, into my waiting heart!<br>
Who am I that I wait to-night?... Alas,<br>
Where is the old content of maidenhood,<br>
The calmness and the laughter and the song,<br>
The patient hands unshaken as the needle<br>
Plied to the gentle rhythm that my lips<br>
Murmured, untroubled girlhood at their brink?<br><br>

Was that but yesterday?... How long ago,<br>
How the swift moments flow along the flood.<br>
For yesterday was sweet indifference;<br>
These little drooping breasts had never known<br>
This pain that swells them out and makes them ache<br>
For Love to touch them, for the nestling lips<br>
To trouble them as a warm lifting wind<br>
Murmurs between two swelled and ripening grapes<br>
Whispering of future wines of mad delight.<br>
Ah, let me learn of this! A rapture fills<br>
My limbs, and in my womb there stirs a craving<br>
For life ... life! Oh, wonderful, the vision that glows<br>
About me in such radiance, the light, the strife<br>
Of music, hue and perfume of the rose.<br>
Oh garden of desire, where one awaits<br>
My coming with the sudden knowledge glowing<br>
Deep in my eyes, made sombre as the day<br>
Is somber in the summer noon of light.<br>
Now I perceive I am a sacred temple <br>
Long closed about the hidden flame of life,<br>
Closed with white ivories and gliding shapes<br>
Of river waves, and waves upon the sea<br>
Rising and gliding. Every magic curve<br>
Of these unheeded arms, this supple waist &mdash; <br>
So are my eyes set on the infinite &mdash; <br>
Are ministering music unto life<br>
Calling love forth to worship in my shrine,<br>
To fill this temple with the prophecy<br>
Of further, wider, deeper life to come.<br><br>

Hark! The music of the night is rising up!<br>
My neighbour's house is all a flame of song.<br>
I must abide until the prelude closes,<br>
Until his heart has ceased its preparation<br>
And he comes forth into the dying year,<br>
Leaves his house of inspiration empty,<br>
And with a loneliness of heart creeps forth<br>
Eagerly into the night, and gropes his way<br>
With outstretched nerveless hands unto my home,<br>
Where I wait, alone! I hear his lips<br>
Murmur again, and moan, and murmur again<br>
Tones of the broken prelude, vainly trying<br>
To call me forth, who am waiting in my home,<br>
Waiting in sweet imprisonment, the bonds<br>
Of love restraining me from running forth<br>
To greet him and to lead him to my soul.<br><br>

Oh the swift pain, the agony of waiting,<br>
Galled with these terrible sweet bonds of love<br>
That will not let me rise, though my cold hands<br>
Are wrung with grief ... for do I not behold<br>
Upon the outer night the rising fire,<br>
The danger and the terror of love's flight;<br>
Do I not know my lover; that his eyes<br>
Are blinded by this madness of the skies.<br>
Do I not hear him moaning in the night<br>
For one to lead him to his waiting love,<br>
To lead him to the temple of delight,<br>
To the white ivory casket where his soul<br>
Is set with lovely secrets? Do I not hear<br>
The little echoes roll, and fade, and fret<br>
About the murmuring foliage of the garden<br>
Wherein the temple lies? Do I not fear<br>
Lest in the outer glories he be lost<br>
And thwarted of his heart's desire, that flies<br>
Like a dove before his coming, and alights<br>
Within the inner courtyard of my soul<br>
Bearing such messages of him who comes<br>
That all the altars of my love are kindled<br>
To flame ere he approaches, which fades away<br>
And counterfeits the sweetest death that ever<br>
Sighed the approach of day, and left the stars<br>
More bright to be entranced of the dawn?<br><br>

Be patient, Oh, my heart! A little while<br>
And he shall pierce the darkness of the night<br>
That flows between my home and his. The song<br>
The youth, the early light that he has lost<br>
Are as a little strength submerged and drowned<br>
In this fierce rage that bids him seek me out<br>
And take me in the darkness of my home,<br>
And change, and fill me, as the virgin night<br>
Is changed to day, and as the moonlight sky<br>
Is emptied of her sterile ray, and filled<br>
With overflooding light that spills to earth<br>
A golden augury of later fruits<br>
And a diviner birth.<br><br>

                         Hark! Hark!... He comes<br>
He has found the temple of his soul's desire ...,<br>
Be still, Oh beating heart, be still ... be still,<br>
Lest he be troubled now his sacred fire<br>
Creeps through this temple to your inmost shrine.<br>
And I at last am his, and he is mine!</blockquote>

While every bird enjoyed his song,<br>
Without one thought of harm or wrong &mdash; <br>

<blockquote>My song, that's bird-like in its kind,<br>
Is in the mind,<br>
Love &mdash; in the mind;<br>
And in my season I am moved<br>
No more or less from being loved;<br>
No woman's love has power to bring<br>
My song back when I cease to sing;<br>
Nor can she, when my season's strong,<br>
Prevent my mind from song.<br><br>

But where I feel your woman's part,<br>
Is in the heart,<br>
Love &mdash; in the heart;<br>
For when that bird of mine broods long,<br>
And I'd be sad without my song,<br>
Your love then makes my heart a brook<br>
That dreams in many a quiet nook,<br>
And makes a steady, murmuring sound<br>
Of joy the whole year round.</blockquote><br>

And now, when I grow old,<br>

His head pecked more than half away;<br>
That hopped about, with but one eye,<br>
Ready to fight again, and die &mdash; <br>
Ofttimes since then their private lives<br>
Have spoilt that joy their music gives.<br><br>

So, when I see this robin now,<br>
Like a red apple on the bough,<br>
And question why he sings so strong,<br>
For love, or for the love of song;<br>
Or sings, maybe, for that sweet rill<br>
Whose silver tongue is never still &mdash; <br><br>

Ah, now there comes this thought unkind,<br>
Born of the knowledge in my mind:<br>
He sings in triumph that last night<br>
He killed his father in a fight;<br>
And now he'll take his mother's blood &mdash; <br>
The last strong rival for his food.</blockquote><br>

  The force of this strong love in me so deep.<br><br>

Yes, I will make you, though you seem so calm,<br>
  Look from your blue eyes that divinest joy<br>
As was in Juno's, when she made great Jove<br>
  Forget the war and half his heaven in Troy.<br><br>

And I will press your lips until they mix<br>
  With my poor quality their richer wine:<br>
Be my Parnassus now, and grow more green<br>
  Each upward step towards your top divine.</blockquote>

Here in the abbey close,<br>
Pouring from your lilac-bough<br>
Note on pebbled note,<br>
Why do you sing so,<br>
Making your song so bright.<br>
Swelling to a throbbing curve<br>
That brave little throat?<br><br>

Soon, but a season brief,<br>
The lice among your feathers,<br>
Stiff-winged and aimless-eyed,<br>
With song dead you shall fall;<br>
Refuse of some clotted ditch,<br>
Seeking no more berries;<br>
Why with lyric numbers now<br>
Do you the twilight call?<br><br>

Proud in your tawny plumes<br>
Mottled in devising,<br>
Singing as though never sang<br>
Bird in close till now &mdash; <br>
Sharp are the javelins<br>
Of death that are seeking,<br>
Seeking even simple birds<br>
On a lilac-bough.<br><br>

Crushed, forlorn, a frozen thing,<br>
For no more nesting,<br>
For no more speckled eggs<br>
In pattered cup of clay, &mdash; <br>
Soon your song shall come to this<br>
You who make the twilight yours,<br>
And echoes of the abbey,<br>
At the end of day.<br><br>

In the song I hear it,<br>
The thud of a poor feathered death,<br>
In the swelling throat I see<br>
The splintering of song &mdash; <br>
What demon then has worked in me<br>
To tease my brain to bitterness &mdash; <br>
In me who have loved bird and tree<br>
So long, so long?<br><br>

Until I come to charity,<br>
Until I find peace again,<br>
My curse upon the fiend or god<br>
That will not let me hear<br>
A bird in song upon the bough<br>
But, hovering about the notes,<br>
There chimes the maniac beating<br>
Of black-winged fear.</blockquote>

Hush! If it would but speak &mdash; <br>
That shadow athwart the stream,<br>
In the gloom of a dream;<br><br>

Could my brain but spell<br>
The thought in the brain of that weak<br>
Old ghost that hides in the gloom,<br>
Over there, of the chestnut bloom.<br><br>

I sit in the broad June light<br>
On the open bank of the river,<br>
In the summer of manhood, young;<br>
And over the water bright<br>
Is a lair that is overhung<br>
With coned pink blooms that quiver<br>
And droop, till the water's breast<br>
Is of petal and leaf caressed.<br><br>

And the June sky glares on my prime &mdash; <br>
But there in the gloom, with Time,<br>

Is a shadow that is my wrack.<br>

I go, and leave it there,<br>
My ghost with Time in its lair,<br>
And the things that must yet be done<br>
Tear at my heart unknown,<br>
And the years have tongues of stone<br>
With no syllable to make<br>
For consolation's sake.<br><br>

But peradventure yet<br>
I shall return<br>
To dare the weeds of death,<br>
And plunge through the coned pink bloom,<br>
And cry on that spectre set<br>
In its silent ring of gloom,<br>
And stay my youth to learn<br>
The thing that my old age saith.</blockquote><br>

<h3>Shepherd Singing Ragtime</h3>

<blockquote>The shepherd sings: &mdash; <br>
    "<i>Way down in Dixie,<br>
    Way down in Dixie,<br>
Where the hens are dog-gone glad to lay</i> ..."<br><br>

With shaded eyes he stands to look<br>
Across the hills where the clouds swoon,<br>
He singing, leans upon his crook,<br>
  He sings, he sings no more.<br>
The wind is muffled in the tangled hairs<br>
Of sheep that drift along the noon.<br>
  One mild sheep stares<br>
With amber eyes about the pearl-flecked June.<br>
  Two skylarks soar<br>
  With singing flame<br>
Into the sun whence first they came.<br>
All else is only grasshoppers<br>
Or a brown wing the shepherd stirs,<br>
Who, like a tall tree moving, goes<br>
Where the pale tide of sheep-drift flows.<br><br>

    See! the sun smites<br>
    With sea-drawn lights<br>
The turned wing of a gull that glows<br>
Aslant the violet, the profound<br>
Dome of the mid-June heights.<br><br>

Alas! again the grasshoppers,<br>
The birds, the slumber-winging bees,<br>
Alas! again for those and these<br>
Demure and sweet things drowned;<br>
Drowned in vain raucous words men made<br>
Where no lark rose with swift and sweet<br>
Ascent and where no dim sheep strayed<br>
About the stone immensities,<br>
Where no sheep strayed and where no bees<br>
Probed any flowers nor swung a blade<br>
    Of grass with pollened feet.<br><br>

He sings: &mdash; <br>
    "<i>In Dixie,<br>
    Way down in Dixie,<br>
Where the hens are dog-gone glad to lay<br>
Scrambled eggs in the new-mown hay</i>..."<br><br>

The herring-gulls with peevish cries<br>
Rebuke the man who sings vain words;<br>
His sheep-dog growls a low complaint,<br>
Then turns to chasing butterflies.<br>
But when the indifferent singing-birds<br>
From midmost down to dimmest shore<br>
Innumerably confirm their songs,<br>
And grasshoppers make summer rhyme<br>
And solemn bees in the wild thyme<br>
Clash cymbals and beat gongs,<br>
The shepherd's words once more are faint,<br>
The shepherd's song once more is thinned<br>
Upon the long course of the wind,<br>
  He sings, he sings no more.<br><br>

Ah, now the sweet monotonies<br>
Of bells that jangle on the sheep<br>
To the low limit of the hills!<br>
Till the blue cup of music spills<br>
Into the boughs of lowland trees;<br>
Till thence the lowland singings creep<br>
Into the silenced shepherd's head,<br>
  Creep drowsily through his blood:<br>
The young thrush fluting all he knows,<br>
The ring-dove moaning his false woes,<br>
Almost the rabbit's tiny tread,<br>
  The last unfolding bud.<br><br>

  But now,<br>
Now a cool word spreads out along the sea.<br>
Now the day's violet is cloud-tipped with gold.<br>
  Now dusk most silently<br>
Fills the hushed day with other wings than birds'.<br>
Now where on foam-crest waves the seagulls rock,<br>
To their cliff-haven go the seagulls thence.<br>
So too the shepherd gathers in his flock,<br>
  Because birds journey to their dens,<br>
  Tired sheep to their still fold.<br>
A dark first bat swoops low and dips<br>
About the shepherd who now sings<br>
A song of timeless evenings;<br>
For dusk is round him with wide wings,<br>
Dusk murmurs on his moving lips.<br><br>

<i>There is not mortal man who knows<br>
From whence the, shepherd's song arose:<br>
  It came a thousand years ago.<br><br>

Once the world's shepherds woke to lead<br>
The folded sheep that they might feed<br>
  On green downs where winds blow.<br>
One shepherd sang a golden word.<br>
A thousand miles away one heard.<br>
  One sang it swift, one sang it slow.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Three skylarks heard, three skylarks told<br>
All shepherds this same song of gold<br>
  On all downs where winds blow.<br><br>

This is the song that shepherds must<br>
Sing till the green downlands be dust<br>
  And tide of sheep-drift no more flow:<br><br>

The song three skylarks told again<br>
To all the sheep and shepherd men<br>
  On green downs where winds blow.</i></blockquote><br><br>

<blockquote>On hills too harsh for firs to climb,<br>
  Where eagle dare not hatch her brood,<br>
  Upon the peak of solitude,<br>
  With anvils of black granite crude<br>
I forge austerities of rhyme.<br><br>

Such godlike stuff my spirit drinks<br>
  I make grand odes of tempests there.<br>
  The steel-winged eagle, if he dare<br>
  To cleave these tracts of frozen air,<br>
Hearing such music, swoops and sinks.<br><br>

Stark clangours of forgotten wars,<br>
  Tumults of primal love and hate,<br>
  Through crags of song reverberate.<br>
  Held by the Singer of High State,<br>
Battalions of the midnight pause.<br><br>

On hills uplift from Space and Time,<br>
  Upon the peak of Solitude,<br>
  With stars to give my furnace food,<br>
  On anvils of black granite crude<br>
I forge austerities of rhyme.</blockquote><br><br>

<h3>The Palaces of the Rose</h3><br>

<blockquote>Which of my palaces? Gold one by one,<br>
Of all the splendid houses of my throne,<br>
This day in grave thought have I over-gone:<br>
Those roofs of stars where I have lived alone<br>
Gladly with God; those blue-encompassed bowers<br>
Hushed round with lakes, and guarded with still flowers,<br>
Where I have watched a face from eve till morn,<br>
Wondering at being born &mdash; <br>
Then on from morn again till the next eve,<br>
Still with strange eyes, unable to believe;<br>
And yet, though week and month and year went by.<br>
Incredulous of my ensorcelled eye.<br>
O had I thus in trance for ever stayed,<br>
Still were she there in the reed-girdled isle,<br>
And I there still &mdash; I who go treading now<br>
Eternity, a-hungered mile by mile:<br>
Because I pressed one kiss upon her brow, &mdash; <br>
After a thousand years that seemed an hour<br>
Of looking on my flower,<br>
After that patient planetary fast,<br>
One kiss at last;<br>
One kiss &mdash; and then strange dust that once was she.<br><br>

Sayest thou, Rose, "What is all this to me?"<br>
This would I answer, if it pleaseth thee,<br>
Thou Rose and Nightingale so strangely one:<br>
That of my palaces, gold one by one,<br>
I fell a-thinking, pondering which to-day,<br>
The day of the Blessed Saint, Saint Valentine,<br>
Which of those many palaces of mine,<br>
I, with bowed head and lowly bended knee,<br>
Might bring to thee.<br>
O which of all my lordly roofs that rise<br>
To kiss the starry skies<br>
May with great beams make safe that golden head,<br>
With all that treasure of hair showered and spread.<br>
Careless as though it were not gold at all &mdash; <br>
Yet in the midnight lighting the black hall;<br>
And all that whiteness lying there as though<br>
It were but driven snow.<br>
Pondering on all these pinnacles and towers,<br>
That, as I come with trumpets, call me lord,<br>
And crown their battlements with girlhood flowers,<br>
I can but think of one.  'Twas not my sword<br>
That won it, nor was it aught I did or dreamed,<br>
But O it is a palace worthy thee!<br>
For all about it flows the eternal sea,<br>
A blue moat guarding an immortal queen;<br>
And over it an everlasting crown<br>
That, as the moon comes and the sun goes down,<br>
Adds jewel after jewel, gem on gem,<br>
To the august appropriate diadem<br>
Of her, in whom all potencies that are<br>
Wield sceptres and with quiet hands control,<br>
Kind as that fairy wand the evening star,<br>
Or the strong angel that we call the soul.<br><br>

Thou splendid girl that seemest the mother of all,<br>
Dear Ceres-Aphrodite, with every lure<br>
That draws the bee to honey, with the call<br>
Of moth-winged night to sinners, yet as pure<br>
As the white nun that counts the stars for beads;<br>
Thou blest Madonna of all broken needs,<br>
Thou Melusine, thou sister of sorrowing man,<br>
Thou wave-like laughter, thou dear sob in the throat,<br>
Thou all-enfolding mercy, and thou song<br>
That gathers up each wild and wandering note,    <br>
And takes and breaks and heals and breaks the heart<br>
With the omnipotent tenderness of art;<br>
And thou Intelligence of rose-leaves made<br>
That makes that little thing the brain afraid.<br><br>

For thee my Castle of the Spring prepares:<br>
On the four winds are sped my couriers,<br>
For thee the towered trees are hung with green;<br>
Once more for thee, O queen,<br>
The banquet hall with ancient tapestry<br>
Of woven vines grows fair and still more fair.<br>
And ah! how in the minstrel gallery<br>
Again there is the sudden string and stir<br>
Of music touching the old instruments,<br>
While on the ancient floor<br>
The rushes as of yore<br>
Nymphs of the house of spring plait for your feet &mdash; <br>
Ancestral ornaments.<br>
And everywhere a hurrying to and fro,<br>
And whispers saying, "She is so sweet &mdash; so sweet";<br>
O violets, be ye not too late to blow,<br>
O daffodils be fleet:<br>
For, when she comes, all must be in its place,<br>
All ready for her entrance at the door,<br>
All gladness and all glory for her face,<br>
All flowers for her flower-feet a floor;<br>
And, for her sleep at night in that great bed<br>
Where her great locks are spread,<br>
O be ye ready, ye young woodland streams<br>
To sing her back her dreams.</blockquote>

<h3>Peace, </h3><br>

<h4><i>June 28th, 1919</i></h4><br>


<blockquote>From the tennis lawn you can hear the guns going,<br>
    Twenty miles away,<br>
Telling the people of the home counties<br>
    That the peace was signed to-day.<br>
To-night there'll be feasting in the city;<br>
    They will drink deep and eat &mdash; <br>
Keep peace the way you planned you would keep it<br>
    (If we got the Boche beat).<br>
Oh, your plan and your word, they are broken,<br>
    For you neither dine nor dance;<br>
And there's no peace so quiet, so lasting,<br>
    As the peace you keep in France.<br><br>

You'll be needing no Covenant of Nations<br>
    To hold your peace intact.<br>
It does not hang on the close guarding<br>
    Of a frail and wordy pact.<br>
When ours screams, shattered and driven,<br>
    Dust down the storming years,<br>
Yours will stand stark, like a grey fortress,<br>
    Blind to the storm's tears.<br><br>

Our peace ... your peace ... I see neither.<br>
    They are a dream, and a dream.<br>
I only see you laughing on the tennis lawn;<br>
    And brown and alive you seem,<br>
As you stoop over the tall red foxglove,<br>
    (It flowers again this year)<br>
And imprison within a freckled bell<br>
    A bee, wild with fear....<br><br>

       *       *       *       *       *<br><br>

Oh, you cannot hear the noisy guns going:<br>
    You sleep too far away.<br>
It is nothing to you, who have your own peace,<br>
    That our peace was signed to-day.</blockquote><br>

That love must have her funeral;<br>

Can turn to meet their eyes and hold<br>
Their hearts with chains of silky gold;<br>
That never more her hands can be<br>

I think I would not go with them,<br>
Her lordly lovers, to the place<br>
Where lies that lovely mournful face,<br>
That curving throat and marvellous hair<br>
Under the sconces' yellow flare &mdash; <br>
How shall a man be comforted<br>
When love is dead, when love is dead?<br><br>

But I would make my moan apart,<br>
Keeping my dreams within my heart &mdash; <br>
For guarded as a sepulchre<br>
Shall be the house I built for her<br>
Of silver spires and pinnacles<br>
With carillons of mellow bells,<br>
A house of song for her delight<br>
Whose joy was as the strong sunlight &mdash; <br>
But now love's ultimate word is said,<br>
For love is dead, for love is dead!<br><br>

But even should all hope be lost<br>
Some memory, like a thin white ghost,<br>
Might stealthily move in midnight hours<br>
Among those silent sacred towers,<br>

Until the cold ironic dawn<br>
Arises from her saffron bed &mdash; <br>

  In chaos ere my time or world began,<br>
Thy finger shaped my body cunningly,<br>
  Thy thought conceived me ere I was a man!<br>
Thy Spirit breathed upon me in the dark<br>

Praise! that a babe I leapt upon the world<br>

With trees as giants, flowers as flags unfurled.<br>
  And rains as diamonds in their excellence!<br>
Praise! for the solemn splendour of surprise<br>
  That came with breaking day;<br>
For all the ranks of stars that met my eyes<br>
  When sunset burned away!<br><br>

Praise! that there burst on my unfolding heart<br>
  The coloured radiance of leafy June,<br>
With choirs of song-birds perfected in art,<br>
  And nightingales beneath the summer moon &mdash; <br>
Praise! that this beauty, an unravished bride<br>

<br>
<h3>Aforetime</h3><br>

<h4><i>To Gordon Bottomley</i></h4><br>

<blockquote>Dear exile from the hurrying crowd,<br>
At work I muse to you aloud;<br>
Thought on my anvil softens, glows,<br>
And I forget our art has foes;<br>
For life, the mother of beauty, seems<br>
A joyous sleep with waking dreams.<br>
Then the toy armoury of the brain<br>
Opining, judging, looks as vain<br>
As trowels silver gilt for use<br>
Of mayors and kings, who have to lay<br>
Foundation stones in hope they may<br>
Be honoured for walls others build.<br>
I, in amicable muse,<br>
With fathomless wonder only filled,<br>
Whisper over to your ear<br>
Listening two hundred odd miles north,<br>
And give thought chase that, were you here,<br>
Our talk would never run to earth.<br><br>

Man can answer no momentous question:<br>
Whence comes his spirit? Has it lived before?<br>
Reason fails; hot springs of feeling spout<br>
Their snowy columns high in the dim land<br>
Of his surmise &mdash; violent divine decisions<br>
That often rule him: and at times he views<br>
Portraits of places he has never been to,<br>
Yet more minute and vivid than remembrance,<br>
Of boyhood homes, sail between sleep and waking<br>
Like some mirage, refuting all experience<br>
With topsy-turvy ships,<br>
That steals by in dead calms through tropic haze:<br>
And many a man in his climacteric years,<br>
Thoughts and remembered words have roused from sleep<br>
With knowledge that he lacked on lying down:<br>
And I, lapped in a trance of reverie, doubt<br>
Some spore of episodes<br>
Anterior far beyond this body's birth,<br>
Dispersed like puffs of dust impalpable,<br>
Wind-carried round this globe for centuries,<br>
May, breathed with common air, yet swim the blood,<br>
And striking root in this or that brain, raise<br>
Imaginations unaccountable;<br>
One such seems half-implied in all I am,<br>
And many times re-pondered shapes like this:<br><br>

A child myself I watched a woman loll<br>
Like to a clot of seaweed thrown ashore;<br>
Heavy and limp as cloth soaked in black dye,<br>
She glooms the noontide dazzle where a bay<br>
Bites into vineyarded flats close-fenced by hills,<br>
Over whose tops lap forests of cork and fir<br>
And reach in places half down their rough slopes.<br>
Lower, some few cleared fields square on the thickets<br>
Of junipers and longer thorns than furze<br>
So clumped that they are trackless even for goats<br>
I know two things about that woman: first<br>
She is a slave and I am free, and next<br>
As mothers need their sons' love she needs mine.<br>
Longings to utter fond compassionate sounds<br>
Stir through me, checked by knowing wiser folk<br>
Reprobate such indulgence. Ill at ease,<br>
Mute, yet her captive, I thrust brown toes through<br>
Loose sand no daily large tides overwhelm<br>
To cake and roll it firm and smooth and clean<br>
As the Atlantic remakes shores, you know.<br>
But there, like trailing skirts, long flaws of wind<br>
Obliterate the prints feet during calms<br>
Track over and over its always lonely stretch,<br>
Till some will have, it ghosts must rove at night;<br>
For folk by day are rare, yet a still week<br>
Leaves hardly ten yards anywhere uncrossed;<br>
Tempest spreads all revirginate like snow,<br>
Half burying dead wood snapped off from tossed trees,<br>
Since right along the foreshore, out of reach<br>
Of furious driven waves, three hundred pines<br>
Straggle the marches between sand and soil.<br>
Like maps of stone-walled fields their branching roots<br>
Hold the silt still so that thin grass grows there,<br>
Its blades whitened with travelling powdery drift<br>
The besom of the lightest breeze sets stirring.<br>
That woman's gaze toils worn from remote years,<br>
Yet forward yearns through the bright spacious noon,<br>
Beyond the farthest isle, whose filmy shape<br>
Floats faint on the sea-line.<br>
I, scooping grains up with the frail half-shell<br>
Pale green and white-lined of sea-urchin, knew<br>
What her eyes sought as often children know<br>
Of grief or sin they could not name or think of<br>
Yet sooth or shrink from, so I saw and longed<br>
To heal her tender wound and yet said naught.<br>
The energy of bygone joy and pain<br>
Had left her listless figure charged with magic<br>
That caught and held my idleness near hers.<br>
Resentful of her power, my spirit chafed<br>
Against its own deep pity, as though it were<br>
Raised ghost and she the witch had bid it haunt me.<br>
What's more I knew this slave by rights should glean<br>
And faggot drift-wood, not lounge there and waste<br>
My father's food dreaming his time away.<br>
For then as now the common-minded rich<br>
Grudged ease to those whose toil brought them in means<br>
For every waste of life. At length I spoke,<br>
Insulting both my inarticulate soul<br>
And her with acted anger: "Lazy wretch,<br>
Is it for eyes like yours to watch the sea<br>
As though you waited for a homing ship?<br>
My father might with reason spend his hours<br>
Scanning the far horizon; for his Swan<br>
Whose outward lading was full half a vintage<br>
Is now months overdue." She turned on me<br>
Her languor knit and, through its homespun wrap,<br>
Her muscular frame gave hints of rebel will,<br>
While those great caves of night, her eyes, faced mine,<br>
Dread with the silence of unuttered wrongs:<br>
At last she spoke as one who must be heeded.<br>
Truly I am not clear<br>
Whether her meaning was conveyed in words<br>
(She mingled accents of an eastern tongue<br>
With deformed phrases of our native Latin)<br>
Or whether thought from her gaze poured through mine.<br>
The gravity of recollected life<br>
Was hers, condensed and, like a vision, flashed<br>
Suddenly on the guilty mind, a whole<br>
Compact, no longer a mere tedious string<br>
Of moments negligible, each so small<br>
As they were lived, but stark like a slain man<br>
Who would alive have been ourself with twice<br>
The skill, the knowledge, the vitality<br>
Actually ours. Yea, as a tree may view<br>
With fingerless boughs and lorn pole impotent,<br>
An elephant gorged upon its leaves depart,<br>
Men often have reviewed an unwieldy past,<br>
That like a feasted Mammoth, leisured and slow,<br>
Turned its back on their warped bones. Even thus,<br>
Momentous with reproach, her grave regard<br>
Made me feel mean, cashiered of rank and right,<br>
My limbs that twelve good years had nursed were numbed<br>
And all their fidgety quicksilver grew stiff,<br>
Novel and fevering hallucinations <br>
Invaded my attention. So daylight<br>
When shutters are thrown back spreads through a house;<br>
As then the dreams and terrors of the night<br>
Decamp, so from my mind were driven<br>
All its own thoughts and feelings. Close she leant<br>
Propped on a swarthy arm, while the other helped<br>
With eloquent gesture potent as wizard wand,<br>
Veil the world off as with an airy web,<br>
Or flowing tent a-gleam with pictured folds.<br>
These tauten and distend &mdash; one sea of wheat,<br>
Islanded with black cities, borders now<br>
The voluminous blue pavilion of day.<br>
There-under to the nearest of those towns<br>
This woman younger by ten years made haste<br>
While at her side ran a small boy of six.<br>
They neared the walls, half a huge double gate<br>
Lay prostrate, though the other by stone hinges<br>
Hung to its flanking tower. The path they followed<br>
Threaded an old paved road whose flags were edged<br>
With dry grass and dry weeds, even cactuses<br>
Had pushed the stones up or found root in muck heaps:<br>
The path struck up the slope of the fallen door,<br>
Basalt like midnight, o'er which dusty feet<br>
Had greyed a passage, for it rested on<br>
Some débris fallen from the left-hand tower,<br>
And from its upper edge rude blocks like steps<br>
Led down into the straight main street, that ran<br>
Past eyeless buildings mined as it were from coal,<br>
And earthquake-raised to light. Palaces and<br>
Roofless wide-flighted colonnaded temples,<br>
The uncemented walls piled-plumb with blocks<br>
Squared, polished, fitted with daemonic patience.<br>
Each gaping threshold high again as need be<br>
Waited a nine-foot lord to enter hall,<br>
Where the least draughty corner sheltered now<br>
Half-tented hut or improvised small home<br>
For Arab, brown, light-footed and proud-necked<br>
As was this woman with the compelling voice.<br>
Their present hutched and hived within that past<br>
As bees in the parchment chest of Samson's lion;<br>
And all seem conscious that their life was sweet,<br>
Like mice who clean their faces after meals<br>
And have such grace of movement, when unscared,<br>
As wins the admiration even of those<br>
Whose stores they rob and soil. I saw her eyes<br>
Young with contentment in her son<br>
And smaller babe and in their handsome sire,<br>
And knew that many a supper had been relished<br>
With hearts as joyous as waited while she cooked<br>
And served upon returning to their cot<br>
In hall where once far other hearts caroused.<br>
They and their tribe could never reap a tithe<br>
Of the vast harvest rustling round those ruins,<br>
And over which a half-moon soon set forth<br>
From black hills mounded up both east and south,<br>
While north-west her light played on distant summits;<br>
All the huge interspace floored with standing corn<br>
Which kings afar send soldiery to reap,<br>
Who now, beside a long canal cut straight<br>
In ancient days, have pitched their noisy camp<br>
Which on that vast staid silence makes a bruise<br>
Of blare and riot that its robust health<br>
Will certainly heal in a brief lapse of time.<br><br>

One night, re-thought on after ten whole years,<br>
Is like the condor high above the Andes,<br>
A speck with difficulty found again<br>
Once the attention quits it. And I next<br>
Descried our woman under breathless noon,<br>
Bathing in a clear lane of gliding water<br>
Whose banks seem lonely as the path of light<br>
Crossing mid ocean south of Capricorn.<br>
Her son steals warily after a butterfly<br>
And is as hushed with hope to capture it<br>
As are the birds with heat. An insect hum<br>
Circles the spot as round a cymbal's rim,<br>
Long after it has clanged, tingles a throb<br>
Which in a dream forgets the parent sound,<br>
Oppressed by this protracted and awe-filled pause,<br>
She hardly dares to wade the stream and moves<br>
As though in dread to wake some sleeping god,<br>
Yet still she nears and nears the further bank<br>
Where there is shade under a shumac's eaves.<br>
The brilliant surface cut her right in two,<br>
And the reflection of her bronzed torso<br>
Hid all beneath the polished gliding mirror;<br>
How her face listened to that sleep divine<br>
Whose audible breath was tuned to dreams of bliss!<br><br>

Sudden, as though the woof of heaven were torn,<br>
A strident shout rang from some neighbour shrubs<br>
Three Nubian soldiers ran upon her with<br>
Delighted oily faces. Screaming first<br>
Commands to her small son to make for home,<br>
She laboured to recross the current as when<br>
In nightmares the scared soul expects to die<br>
Tortured by mutiny in limbs like lead,<br>
But as the playful lion of the sea<br>
Climbs the rock ledges hard by Fingal's cave<br>
To throw himself down into deep green baths,<br>
While others barking follow his vigorous lead,<br>
The foremost Abyssinian threw his weight<br>
Before her with a splash that hid them both,<br>
As the explosion of light-filled liquid parcels<br>
Shot forth in all directions. In his arms<br>
She re-appeared, a tragic terrified face<br>
Beside his coarse one laughing with success.<br>
Squeezing her with a pantomime of love,<br>
He turns to follow an arrow with his eyes<br>
That his companion, still upon the bank,<br>
Has aimed towards her son's small head that bobbed<br>
Like a black cork across the basking corn.<br>
But from the level of the sunk stream bed<br>
Neither he nor she could see the target aimed at,<br>
Yet in the pause they heard the poor child scream;<br>
A second arrow, second scream; she fought,<br>
But soon like bundle bound, hung o'er his shoulder,<br>
Helpless as a mouse in cat's mouth carried off<br>
In search of quiet, there to play with it.<br>
Those arrows missed? &mdash; or did they not? The child<br>
Shrieked twice, yet scarcely like a wounded thing<br>
She thought and hoped and still but thinks and hopes.<br>
Where is that boy? Where is her husband now?<br>
While she submitted body to force and soul<br>
To the great shuddering violence of despair<br>
How had their life progressed in that far place?<br>
Compassion fused my consciousness with hers<br>
And second-sighted eloquence arose<br>
To claim my mind for rostrum,<br>
But obstinately tranced<br>
My eyes clung to their vision;<br>
For regions to explore allure the boy<br>
No stretch of thought or sea of feeling tempts.<br>
Entranced, the mind I then had, haunted<br>
Those basalt ruins. High on sable towers<br>
Some silky patriarchal goat appears<br>
And ponders silent streets, or suddenly<br>
Some nanny, her huge bag swollen with milk,<br>
Trots out on galleries that unfenced run<br>
Round vacant courts, there, stopped by plaintive kids,<br>
Lets them complete their meal. While always, always,  <br>
Throughout, those mazed, sullen and sun-soaked walls,<br>
The steady, healthy wind,<br>
Which often blows for weeks without a lull<br>
Across that upland plain,<br>
Flutes staidly. Moaning<br>
Continuously as seas<br>
Or forests before storm,<br>
And, gathering moment,<br>
Articulated by her woe, begins<br>
With second-sighted eloquence<br>
To wail through me,<br>
Nigh as unheeded,<br>
As though it still had been<br>
Meaningless wind.<br><br>

For ah! the heart is cowed<br>
And dares not use her strength,<br>
Hears the kind impulse plead<br>
Against the common avaricious fear,<br>
Grants it but life, though sovereignty was due<br>
Or doles it sway but one day out of seven<br>
Or one a year.<br><br>

So, so, and ever, so<br>
In the close-curtained court<br>
Those causes are deferred<br>
Which most import;<br>
These wait man's leisure.<br>
These daily matters elbow;<br>
Merely because<br>
His panic meanness<br>
Jibs blindly ere it hear<br>
What wisdom has prepared,<br>
Bolts headlong ere it see<br>
Her face unfold its smile.<br>
Man after man, race after race<br>
Drops jaded by the iterancy<br>
Of petty fear.<br>
Even as horses on the green steppes grazing,<br>
Hundreds scattered through lonely peacefulness,<br>
If shadow of cloud or red fox breaking earth<br>
Delude but one with dream of a stealthy foe,<br>
All are stampeded.<br>
Their frantic torrent draws in,<br>
With dire attraction, cumulative force,<br>
Stragglers grazing miles from where it started;<br>
On it thunders quite devoid of meaning.<br>
The tender private soul<br>
Thus takes contagion from the sordid crowd,<br>
And shying at mere dread of loss,<br>
Loses the whole of life.<br>
Thus, in the vortex of a base turmoil,<br>
Those myriad million energies wear down<br>
That might have raised mankind<br>
To live the life of gods.<br>
Had but my soul been his,<br>
As his was mine,<br>
Those wind-resembling accents<br>
Had found fit auditor.<br>
Their second-sighted eloquence,<br>
Welcomed with acclamation,<br>
Had fired action.<br>
But that was ages since: he was not then<br>
What now I am,<br>
Who have no longer<br>
The opportunity then mine, then missed, &mdash; <br>
Who still am dazed and troubled<br>
Surmising others mine, others missed.<br><br>

Passionate, never-wearied voice,<br>
Tombed in thy brittle shell,           <br>
This human heart<br>
Thou croonest age on age,<br>
"Give and ask not,<br>
Help and blame not,"<br>
Heeded less than large and mottled cowry<br>
The which at least some child may hold to ear<br>
All smiles to listen.<br><br>

Thou findest parables;<br>
With fond imagination<br>
Adorning truth<br>
For the successive<br>
Unpersuaded<br>
Generations.<br><br>

This boy, myself that was,<br>
Musing visions by that woman raised,<br>
Watched that land she came from, towned with ruins<br>
Send mile-long files of laden camels out<br>
With grain to hostile cities, &mdash; <br>
Knew too the blue entrancing plain of waters<br>
Teemed with fresh shoals, buoyed up indifferently,<br>
Fisher &mdash; trader &mdash; pirate bark, &mdash; <br>
Even the straight thought whispered at his ear,<br>
"Thy lips might join with hers as with some cousin's,<br>
Here, now, at noon,<br>
Hugging her bereavéd sadness close,<br>
And still, to-night, with equal satisfaction,<br>
Thy mother's blind contentment with her son."<br>
While half-seduced, half-chafed, his mind was shaken<br>
As with conflicting gusts a choppy sea,<br>
His eyes, still greedy of their visions,<br>
Fastened a swarthy town enisled in wheat,<br>
And to the ebon threshold of each house,<br>
Conjured forth the man that each was planned for:<br>
Great creatures smiling with his father's smile,<br>
Muscular, wealthy and self-satisfied,<br>
Wearing loud-coloured raiment, earrings, chains,<br>
Armlet and buckle, all of clanking gold.<br>
His spirit drank from theirs great draughts of pride<br>
And read their minds more clearly than his own;<br>
All, with one counsel like a chorus, dinned<br>
His soul that then was mine,<br>
With truths well-proved in action.<br>
"Love is chaos,<br>
For order's sake<br>
Whatever must be, should be,"<br>
Roared those bulls of Bashan.<br>
Then their proud chant argued,<br>
"How should this woman know<br>
Her little lad again,<br>
Who either now is bones<br>
Under the fertile field,<br>
Or well nigh a grown man?<br>
Say they should cross at market<br>
Both slaves would pass on, not a start the wiser.<br>
What is she then to him<br>
Or he to her<br>
After these years?<br>
To drag a life that might have been but is not<br>
With toil of mind and heart,<br>
Through dreary year on year,<br>
Neglecting for its sake the life that is,<br>
Spells folly and ingratitude to those<br>
Who treat their slaves well.<br>
Thy father's household and thyself should be<br>
More to her now than those who may be dead,<br>
The place she lives in dearer<br>
Than any unattainable far land<br>
Where she is more forgotten than old dreams.    <br>
Why make the day of evil worse<br>
By dwelling on it after it has past?<br>
Near things alone are real,<br>
Now is the whole of time:<br>
Places beyond the horizon are but pictures;<br>
Memory cheats the eye with an illusion!"<br><br>

"Your thoughts are sound, bold builders,<br>
I am my father's son.<br>
Behold this home-shore, these our hills, this bay,<br>
And this our slave! &mdash; <br>
Up, work, look sharp about it!"<br>
Bounding a foot and fast retiring from her,<br>
I stoop for stones strewn thick about the sand,<br>
Aim them, fling them,<br>
And, as my idle arm resumes the knack,<br>
Score a hit and laugh<br>
To see her stumble hurt, behind the pine trunks.<br>
"Unless you work, I throw again,<br>
To it and steady at it.<br>
Mark me, drab, we Camilli<br>
Mean what we say."<br>
Stone after stone still flies,<br>
But aimed to knock chips from the pine-boles now;<br>
For she is busy gathering sticks, increasing<br>
Her distance as she may. The noon is sultry,<br>
Heated and clammy, I,<br>
Towards the live waves turning, slip my tunic,<br>
Then run in naked.<br>
Cooled and soothed by swimming,<br>
Both mind and heart from their late tumult tuned<br>
To placid acquiescent health,<br>
I float, suspended in the limpid water,<br>
Passive, rhythmically governed;<br>
So tranced worlds travel the dark shoreless ether.<br><br>

"Where should this stream of pictures tend?"<br>
No, Bottomley, you will not ask;<br>
To you I am quite free to send<br>
The unexpected, unexplained,<br>
You will not take me thus to task.<br><br>

So they be painted well, they live;<br>
If ill, they yet may cling to fame<br>
Associated with your name.<br>
In which case you, and not I, give<br>
That we are both contented with.</blockquote>

<h3>Down Here the Hawthorn</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>Down here the hawthorn....<br>
And a stir of wings,<br>
Spring-lit wings that wake<br>
Sudden tumult in the brake,<br>
Tumult of blossom tide, tumult of foaming mist<br>
Where the bright bird's tumultuous feathers kissed.<br>
White mists are blinding me,<br>
White mist of hedgerow, white mist of wings.<br>
Down here the hawthorn<br>
And a stir of wings....<br>
Softly swishing, swift with spray<br>
All along the green laneway<br>
Dewdimmed, sunwashed, windsweet and winter-free<br>
They flash upon the light,<br>
They swing across the sight,<br>
I cannot see, I cannot see!...<br><br>

Down here the flowering hawthorn flings<br>
Sleet of petals, petalled shells<br>
Spread the coloured air that sings<br>
Magic and a myriad spells<br>
Spun by my count of Springs.<br>
Down here the hawthorn....<br>
And the flower-foam stirred<br>
By a Spring-lit bird.<br>
White hawthorn mist is blinding me.<br>
I lower my gaze, and on this old<br>
Brown bridle road<br>
Crusted with golden moss and mould<br>
The hedgerow flings<br>
Lush carpetings,<br>
Blossom woven carpetings light lain<br>
Under the farmer's lumbering load;<br>
And, floating past the spent March wrack,<br>
The footstep trail, the traveller's track.<br>
    Down here the hawthorn....<br>
White mists are blinding me,<br>
White mists that rime the fresh green bank<br>
Where fernleaf-fall<br>
And sorrel tall<br>
Upwaving, rank on rank,<br>
Shall flush the bed whereon the windflowers sank.<br><br>

I turn these Spring-bewildered eyes of mine,<br>
I seek above the surf of hedgerow line<br>
Where peeping branches reach, and reaching twine<br>
Faint cherry or plum or eglantine.<br>
But with pretence of whisperings<br>
The year's young mischief-wind shall take<br>
By storm these shy striplings,<br>
And soon or later shake<br>
Their slender limbs, and make<br>
Free with their clinging may &mdash; <br>
Strip from them in a single boisterous day<br>
Their first and last vesture of pale bloom spray.<br>
So, as to meet such lack<br>
In bush or brack,<br>
The kindly hedgerows make<br>
Sure of a Springtime for these frailer things,<br>
Shedding on each the lavish creamthorn flake.<br>
    Down here the hawthorn....<br>
On all the green leaf-clusters round me clings<br>
Thickly a spray of gentle blossomings<br>
Everywhere as with many bells<br>
The young year with white magic swells.<br>
The morning rings.<br>
White mist is blinding me,<br>
I cannot see, I cannot see!<br><br>

Blind grows the coloured air that sings<br>
The marvel of a myriad spells          <br>
Spun by my count of Springs.<br>
Sleet of petals, petalled shells<br>
Falling with sudden poignancy<br>
(As the sleet stings)<br>
Upon the lightheart-hope which only clear sight knows.<br>
And slowly drifts,<br>
Lingering among the snows<br>
Nor, though the snow lifts,<br>
Ever goes<br>
The wistful heartache as the fresh Spring flows<br>
With slipping sureness to the time of the rose, and the withered rose.<br>
    Down here the hawthorn....<br>
And heaping blossom stirred<br>
By a joy-swift bird.<br>
White mists are blinding me,<br>
White mist of hedgerow, white mist of wings.<br>
The bird's flight flings<br>
Deep carpetings<br>
Over the wrack<br>
Of my life's track.<br>
    Down here the hawthorn....<br>
The air of coloured years is blurred<br>
By the Spring, by a bird.<br>
White mists are blinding me,<br>
White mists on the years to be.<br>
I cannot see, I cannot see....</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hurl down, harsh hills, your bitterness<br>
Of wind and storm.<br>
Stem ye the drift of herded men<br>

So, tasting of your power, they press<br>
Back shrinking where upon their warm<br>

They feed their various lusts again.<br><br>

Guard ye, wild hills, with scar and whip<br>

Lest alien-hearted pigmies tame<br>

And with their unclean cunning slip<br>
The leash of civilry<br>
    Fast round your shoulders.<br>
O keep ye from that shame.<br><br>

Or they shall surely come, black hordes<br>
Swarming as lice<br>
With their obscenities and greed<br>
    Across your fastness,<br>
Even your peaks that swing white swords,<br>
Rent, splintered ice<br>
    Into the vastness<br>
Of skies where fanged winds feed.<br><br>

Hurl down, harsh hills, your bitterness,<br>
Guard ye with flail<br>
Of shattering wind and thong of sleet<br>

To the impaled stars; be pitiless<br>
Before this unquiet trail<br>
    Of man-herds drifting<br>
Against your stone still feet.</blockquote>

<h3>PÆAN</h3>

<h4><i>upon seeing a portrait of Blake</i></h4><br>



<blockquote>Something moves in his dust,<br>
Flame sleeps beneath the crust;<br>
O whence had he those eyes<br>
Lit with celestial surprise?<br>
From what world blew that gust?<br>
Are we near to Paradise?<br><br>

Gather a chaplet of five stars<br>
And the opalescent hue<br>
Of the aureole brightness cast &mdash; <br>
Red, hardly red, and blue, scarce blue, &mdash; <br>
Round th' immaculate frosty moon,<br>
Splintering light in glacial spars,<br>
When November's loudening blast<br>
Sweeps heaven's floor till burnished<br>
More crystal than at August noon,<br>
So we fit radiance may cast<br>
Before his feet, around his head.<br><br>

How visits he an earthly place,<br>
Wanders among a mortal race?<br>
How were his footsteps led<br>
That still about his face<br>
Lingers a ghostly trace<br>
Of a secret influence shed<br>
By a Hand the world denies,<br>
In a land her most son flies,<br>
As a gift upon him thrust<br>
For an end he knoweth not,<br>
Yet will shine because he must,<br>
Shine and sing because he must<br>
Reap a wrong he soweth not<br>
Of contempt anger and distrust<br>
For a world which boweth not<br>
To the Flame which binds our dust.<br><br>

Go net the moon, go snare the sun,<br>
Set them upon his either hand!<br>
Beneath his heels Leviathan<br>
Roll your thick coils! His head be spanned<br>
By rainbows tripled! Set a gem<br>
At the Cross-scabbard of his sword<br>
Whiter than lambwool or lilystem!<br>
Place on his brow the diadem<br>
Given the warrior of the Lord,<br>
The crown-turrets of Jerusalem!</blockquote><br><br>

<h3>The Fall</h3><br>

<blockquote>I'll sing a song of kings and queens<br>
And falling leaves and flying rain,<br>
With Time to mow, and Fate who gleans<br>
Their good and evil, boon and bane.<br><br>

I'll sing a song of leaves and rains<br>
And flying queens and falling kings.<br>
Yet doubt not reason still remains<br>
Snug hidden at the core of things.<br><br>

For every year an autumn brings<br>
To round the root and fat the sheaves<br>
And haply garner queens and kings<br>
With falling rain and flying leaves.<br><br>

The rain is salt with tears of queens<br>
The leaves are red with blood of kings;<br>
Unknowing what the mystery means<br>
We puzzle at these splendid things.<br><br>

For why great kings and rains should fall,<br>
And wherefore leaves and queens should fly,<br>
Or such rare wonders be at all,<br>
You cannot tell; no more can I.<br><br>

Yet this we know: new leaves and rain<br>
Anon shall crown the vernal scene,<br>
But dust of dynasts not again<br>
Blows up into a king or queen.</blockquote>

Our wedding day to share.<br><br>

Turn up the glass where she would be<br>

Though them old blids are in the grave<br>
And their good light's gone out,<br>
We'd sooner their kind ghosties have<br>
Than all the living rout<br>
As will be there no doubt.<br><br>

Some flown as cannot flee.<br>
You still do fancy 'em near by.<br>
'Tis so with him and she,<br>
At any rate to we.</blockquote>

	<td>When old Anacreon sang the wine<br>
Which made his utterance divine,<br>
Perchance the eyes he gazed into<br>
Were lucent as the sun-touched dew &mdash; <br>
Brighter, perchance, than yours; and yet<br>
Eyes like yours, smoulderingly lit<br>
With the calm passion of the spirit.<br>
No young Greek maid did e'er inherit....<br>
Ah! twenty years are not enough<br>
To mould to such celestial stuff<br>
A soul, my dear, as yours is moulded,<br>
Wherein all dreams of life lie folded,<br>
And through whose doors a friend may slip<br>
Into serene companionship.</td>

Of many a sunset hour had grown<br>
Half sad, half glad, because the night<br>
So soon about her would be thrown.<br>
With melancholy ages old,<br>
And laughter fragrant as the Spring,<br>
She came, and in her low voice told<br>
Tales of rich joy and sorrowing.<br>
She led me to her garden, fair<br>
With flowers I love and whispering trees,<br>
And to her arbour sheltered there<br>
In peace, all redolent of peace.<br>
With rapt delight of halting speech,<br>
And commune, such as those have felt<br>
Whose minds move silent each by each.<br>
Whose hopes are kindred hopes, we dwelt.<br>
But though with love and dreams of gold<br>
She wove rare charms about that nest,<br>
My heart lay aching still, and cold:<br>
I could not rest, I could not rest.</td>

And fond caresses every day,<br>
A softened thought of me shall come<br>

<h3>The Return</h3>
<br>

<blockquote>Last night, within our little town<br>
    The Dead came marching through;<br>
In a long line, like living men,<br>
    Just as they used to do.<br><br>

Only, so long a line it seemed<br>
    You'd think the Judgment Day<br>
Had dawned, to see them slowly pass,<br>
    With faces turned one way.<br><br>

They walked no longer foe and foe<br>
    But brother bound to brother;<br>
Poor men, common men they walked<br>
    Friendly to one another.<br><br>

Just as in life they might have done<br>
    Who stabbed and slew instead....<br>
So quietly and evenly they walked<br>
    These million gentle dead.</blockquote>

<blockquote>For her the proud stars bend, she sees,         <br>
As never yet, dim sorceries             <br>
Breaking in silver magic wide            <br>
On the blue midnight's swirling tide,          <br>
With arrowy mist and spearing flame<br>
That out of central beauty came.          <br>
The innumerate splendours of the skies        <br>
Are thronging in her shining eyes;          <br>
Her body is a fount of light             <br>
In the plumed garden of the night;          <br>
Her lily breasts have known the bliss<br>
Of the cool air's unfaltering kiss.           <br>
She is made one with loveliness,<br>
Enfranchised from the world's distress,<br>
Given utterly to joy, a bride<br>
With a bride's hunger satisfied.<br>
Now, though she heavily walk, and know        <br>
The sharp premonitory throe            <br>
And the life leaping in the gloom           <br>
Of her most blessed and chosen womb,        <br>
It is as though foot never was            <br>
So light upon the glimmering grass.          <br>
She is shot through with the stars' light,        <br>
Helped by their calm, unwavering might.<br>
In tall, lone-swaying gravity<br>
Stoops to her there the eternal tree          <br>
Whose myriad fruitage ripens on          <br>
Beneath the light of moon and sun.</blockquote>

Never was to utter beauty.<br>
But they sang, but they fluted<br>
And your rasping lies confuted,<br>
And your ugliness laid bare<br>
With a lyric in the air.<br>
So you bought them on a string,<br>
Dangling balls that used to sing,<br>
And you gave them to the cook<br>
With a fat and happy look.<br><br>

But you ask me why this fuss!<br>
Ah, my brave Vitellius,<br>
I am never sure your stringers<br>
May not string you other singers,<br>
May not tire of lark and wren<br>
And attempt to sell you men.<br>
Please forgive me, but I've made<br>
Certain songs ... and I'm afraid!</blockquote>

Once more in bitter anger, you and I,<br>
Over some small, some foolish, trivial thing<br>
Our anger would not decently let die,<br>
But dragged between us, shamed and shivering<br>
Until each other's taunts we scarcely heard,<br>
Until we lost the sense of all we said,<br>
And knew not who first spoke the fatal word.<br>
It seemed that even every kiss we wrung<br>
We killed at birth with shuddering and hate,<br>
As if we feared a thing too passionate.<br>
However close we clung<br>
One hour the next hour found us separate,<br>
Estranged, and Love most bitter on our tongue.<br><br>

To-night we quarrelled over one small head,<br>
Our fruit of last year's maying, the white bud<br>
Blown from our stormy kisses and the dead<br>
First rapture of our wild, estranging blood.<br>
You clutched him: there was panther in your eyes,<br>
We breathed like beasts in thickets, on the wall<br>
Our shadows in huge challenge seemed to rise,<br>
The room grew dark with anger. Yet through all<br>
The shame and hurt and pity of it you were<br>
Still strangely and imperishably dear,<br>
As one who loves the wild day none the less<br>
That breaks in bitter hands the buds of Spring,<br>
Whose cold hand stops the breath of loveliness,<br>
And drives the wailing ghost of beauty past,<br>
Making the rose, &mdash; even the rose, a thing<br>
For pain to be remembered by at last.<br><br>

I said: "My son shall wear his father's sword."<br>
You said: "Shall hands once blossoms at my breast   <br>
Be stained with blood?" I answered with a word<br>
More bitter, and your own, the bitterest<br>
Stung me to sullen anger, and I said:<br>
"My son shall be no coward of his line<br>
Because his mother choose"; you turned your head<br>
And your eyes grew implacable in mine.<br>
And like a trodden snake you turned to meet<br>
The foe with sudden hissing ... then you smiled,<br>
And broke our life in pieces at my feet,<br>
"Your child?" you said: "<i>Your</i> child?"</blockquote>

But the black wood that leans and sighs above her<br>
No tide can turn, no moon can slave nor summon.<br>

The wood still leans ... weeping she turns to seek him,<br>

<blockquote>I came by night to Thèlus wood,<br>
And though in dark and desperate places<br>
Stubborned with wire and brown with blood<br>
Undaunted April crept and sewed<br>
Her violets in dead men's faces,<br>
And in a soft and snowy shroud<br>
Drew the scarred fields with gentle stitch;<br>
Though in the valley where the ditch<br>
Was hoarse with nettles, blind with mud,<br>
She stroked the golden-headed bud,<br>
And loosed the fern, she dared not here<br>
To touch nor tend this murdered thing;<br>
The wind went wide of it, the year<br>
Upon this breast stopped short of Spring:<br>
Beauty turned back from Thèlus Wood.<br><br>

From broken brows the dim eyes stared,<br>
Blistered and maimed the wide stumps grinned<br>
From the black mouth of Thèlus bared<br>
In laughter at some monstrous jest.<br>
No creature moved there, weed nor wind.<br>
Huge arms, half-torn from savage breast,<br>
Hung wide, and tangled limbs and faces<br>
Lay, as if giants blind and stark<br>
With violent, with perverse embraces<br>
Groped for each other in the dark.<br>
A moaning rose &mdash; not of the wind,<br>
 &mdash; There was no wind, but hollowly<br>
From its dim bed of mud each tree<br>
Gave forth a sound, till trees and mud<br>
Seemed but a single, sighing mouth,<br>
A wound that spoke with lips uncouth,<br>
And cried to me from Thèlus Wood.<br><br>

I heard one tree say: "This was I<br>
Who drew great clouds across the sky<br>
To weep against me." This one said:<br>
"I made a gloom where love might lie<br>
All day and dream it night, a bed<br>
Secret and soft, the birds' song had<br>
A twilight sound the whole day there."<br>
One said: "Last night I shook my hair<br>
Before the mirror of the moon."<br>
"I saw a corpse to-day," said one<br>
"That was but buried yester-year."<br>
And one, the smallest, sweetest thing &mdash; <br>
A fair child-tree made never stir,<br>
Dead before God had tended her<br>
In the green nurseries of Spring.<br>
She lay, the loveliest, loneliest,<br>
Among the old and ruined trees,<br>
And at each small and broken wrist<br>
The white flowers grew like bandages.<br><br>

Then from the ruined churchyard where<br>
Old vaults and graves lay turned and tossed<br>
And earth from earth was shaken bare,<br>
Came murmurings of a tongueless host<br>
That to each ghastly brother said:<br>
"Who raised us from our sleep? Is this<br>
The resurrection of the dead?<br>
Upon our bodies no flesh grows,<br>
No bright blood through our temples springs,<br>
No glory spreads, no trumpet blows,<br>
The air is not white and blind with wings.<br>
And yet dragged up before us lie<br>
The woods of Thèlus at our feet,<br>
And strange hills sentinel the sky,<br>
And where the road went yawns a pit.<br>
The world is finished: let us sleep.         <br>
God has forgotten: we shall keep<br>
Here a sweet, safe Eternity.<br>
There is no other end than this,<br>
And this is death, and that is peace."<br>
But even as they ceased the stones<br>
Were loosed, the earth shook where I stood,<br>
And from far off the crouching guns<br>
Swung slowly round on Thèlus Wood.</blockquote>

She shall stand in the gate &mdash; the prize of the world to win,<br>
Stand steel-shod,<br>
Crowned with a cloud of flowers.<br>
I will build up a wall, a wall, for Freedom to dwell therein<br>
In the name of the most high God,<br>
A wall with towers.</blockquote>

<a name="tittsword"></a><h3>The Broken Sword</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>Soldier, soldier, burnishing your sword,<br>
Is there no place for a wayfaring man in the courts of your lord?<br>
A couch, and a crust, and a song, and a flagon of wine?<br>
Haggard, begrimed though I be, and out at heel,<br>
A lean, grey hop-and-go-one with a crutch of steel,<br>
Brother-at-arms with death? Behold the sign:<br><br>

I have tasted great weather on high, white, green-turreted cliffs by the sea.<br>
I have tramped the tough heather, the purple, the brown,<br>
By pools of peat water; from the night to the day,<br>
Till the moon has dropped down: the ghost of a minim, low down,<br>
In a high-piping treble of grey.<br><br>

In shy, dim recesses, mid tresses, green tresses.<br>
Slow dipping, caressing, I've heard<br>
A whisper, a chuckle of laughter, a scamper; and high,<br>
High up in the air the cry, the call of a bird.<br>
And when the night came with a flicker of wings<br>
I have heard the earth breathing quiet and slow<br>
Like a pulse in the tiny, wild tumult of things.<br><br>

I have sung to the sun, and the moon and the stars,<br>
In valleys uncharted of tumbled sea meadows<br>
I have shouted aloud 'neath a sky whipped to smoke in the fret of my spars<br>
And I fought as I fared; and my couch was a camp; and my songs were my scars.<br><br>

Soldier! Soldier! Cosetting your sword!<br>
Have you no place for a harper-at-arms in the courts of your lord &mdash; <br>
Prim fountains, clipped trees, and trim gardens, and music, and rest?             <br>
Nay, keep your sugared delights and your margents embroidered! My life is the best.<br>
In my ears is the sound of a bugle blown, and my pulses like kettle-drums beat<br>
For the hungry blind onset, the rally, the stubborn defeat.<br>
I, too, could have polished, and polished, and jeered at the wayfaring man who passed by.<br>
But I follow the fighting Apollo.<br>
And I stand unashamed; and I raise up my shard of a sword; and I cry the old cry.<br>
Please God they shall find but a hilt in my hand when I die!</blockquote><br>

<a name="tittnight"></a><h3>Night Shapes</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>Dark hurrying shapes beset my path that night &mdash; <br>
Pushing and buffeting; and in my brain<br>
Dark hurrying shapes beset my soul. In vain<br>
I struggled; as a fevered dreamer might;<br>
Or some spent, breathless swimmer, in despite<br>
Of desperate stroke, thrust headlong to the main.<br>
The waking nightmare, monstrous and inane,<br>
Whirled, rushed, and huddled in its random flight.<br><br>

Like a spent swimmer, battling with a swoon,<br>
Silent I fought, yet seemed to cry aloud.<br>
When, at the challenge of a marching tune,<br>
Heard in a sudden stillness of the crowd,<br>
I looked aloft, and saw the great round moon<br>
Steadfast behind her ragged rout of cloud.</blockquote>

<a name="tittsilent"></a><h3>The Silent People</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>The Silent People of No Man's Land        <br>
Calm they lie,<br>
With a stare and vacant smile<br>
At the vacant sky.<br>
Over them swept the battle,<br>
And stirred them not.<br>
Armies passed over, beyond them.<br>
They are forgot.<br><br>

Calmly the earth deals with them,<br>
Melts them away.<br>
Nothing is left of them now but bones,<br>
Bones and clay.<br>
Bones of the Valley of Judgment,<br>
Bones stripped clean.<br>
We fought, day in, day out, and the others,<br>
With this between.<br><br>

Dawn comes white and finds them<br>
Stark and cold.<br>
Twilight creeps over and covers them,<br>
Fold on fold.<br>
Night cannot hide them from us.<br>
In the dark, again,<br>
We see the Silent People<br>
Who once were men.<br><br>

The Silent People of No Man's Land,<br>
They rise, they rise,<br>
With the glory of utter loss<br>
In their stary eyes.<br>
Beckoning, beckoning, calling,<br>
Pointing the way.<br>
But the dawn comes white, and finds them<br>
Bones and clay.<br><br>

Winds of the world blow o'er them<br>
Your serenade!<br>
Touch like a lute the broken earth<br>
Where our dead are laid!<br>
Broken bones of the martyrs,<br>
Reliques of pain,<br>
Anoint them, anoint them with sunlight,<br>
Robe them in rain.<br><br>

The Silent People of No Man's Land<br>
Calm they lie,<br>
Bones, broken and bleached,<br>
Under the sky.<br>
Over them sweeps the tempest,<br>
And stirs them not.<br>
We pass over, beyond them,<br>
They are forgot.</blockquote>

<h3>Lamps and Lanterns</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>When I had sight, great glamour was<br>
In myriad lamps of coloured glass:<br>
Old lamps for new I never sold;<br>
For old were new, and new were old.<br><br>

And Chinese lanterns, paper globes,<br>
Were Dragon Gods in tissue robes<br>
That stood on air with squat, round shoon,<br>
Beneath the thin, receded Moon.</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote><i>Dusk gathers. On the seaward hedge<br>
The wild hops, hanging bright,<br>
Gleam as a foam-spray flung on sedge<br>
From a sea of golden light</i>.<br><br>

A ship lies heavy on the sands<br>
Above the warped, wan tide,<br>
Whose waves thrust ineffectual hands<br>
Beneath its murmuring side.<br><br>

They cannot lift the monstrous hulk,<br>
Nor break the ghostly spell;<br>
The ship lies dreaming, all her bulk<br>
Racked on a shoal of hell.<br><br>

I hear the sullen timbers creak,<br>
With echoings deep and numb;<br>
No other sound: nor groan nor shriek;<br>
For agony is dumb!<br><br>

But at the seams, in every crack,<br>
A beaded sweat appears:<br>
The soul that's stretched on such a rack<br>
Can shed no other tears!</blockquote>

<h3>Rubble</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>We may fill the daytime with friendship<br>
    And laughter and song;<br>
But however the laughter may trip<br>
    And the words break in song<br>
On a loved one's lip;<br>
And however gaily the road may bend<br>
    Into the sky,<br>
It must come to this in the end,<br>
    That we stand<br>
And watch the last friend<br>
    Turn with a half-felt sigh<br>
    And a wave of the hand;<br>
And silence is over the day,<br>
    Shadows fall,<br>
And our happiness crumbles away<br>
    Like a wall<br>
That nobody cares for,<br>
    That falls stone by stone<br>
Till its grandeur is rubble once more,<br>
    And we are alone.</blockquote>

<h3>Christmas</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>Word through the world went<br>
  On Christmas morn, &mdash; <br>
'Tidings! behold, a<br>
  Townsman is born!'<br><br>

Then in their council<br>
  Smiled the high lords:<br>
'Sword for world-conquest<br>
  'Mid a world's swords.<br>
Need shall our armies<br>
  Have of each birth,<br>
In that last battle<br>
  Wins us the earth.'<br><br>

Still were the priesthood,<br>
  Singing the Mass:<br>
'Lo, is our creed come<br>
  Truly to pass?<br>
Blesséd and broken<br>
  Crumbs that we give,<br>
Say! say, O chalice,<br>
  Can a creed live?<br><br>

Then to lord Shakespeare,<br>
  Brooding alone,<br>
While in a vision<br>
  Lear was shown,<br>
While his just loathing<br>
  Hung over men,<br>
Lo, from the darkness<br>
  Came Imogen.<br><br>

Then said a free maid,<br>
    Heart against mine, &mdash; <br>
Take me, lord governor,<br>
    Who am all thine!<br>
Thou that hast blessed me<br>
    With a new light,<br>
Ah, is thy handmaid<br>
    Fair in thy sight?'<br><br>

Then said our Lady, &mdash; <br>
    'Clean is the hut,<br>
Filled are the platters,<br>
    And the door shut.<br>
Sit, O son Jesus!<br>
    Sit thou, sweet friend!<br>
Poor folk have supper<br>
    And their woes end.'<br><br>

'Now,' said our Father,<br>
    'All things are won:<br>
Welcome, O Saviour!<br>
    Welcome, O Son!<br>
More than creation<br>
    Lives now again,<br>
God hath borne Godhead<br>
    Nowise in vain.'<br><br>

Word went through Sarras<br>
    On Easter morn, &mdash; <br>
'Tidings! behold a<br>
    Townsman is born!'</blockquote>

<a name="willbris"></a><h3>Briseis</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>The footfalls of the parting Myrmidons         <br>
    And counter-cries of leaguer and of town<br>
    Are hushed behind her as the silks drop down;<br>
Alone she stands, and wonderingly cons<br>
Heads circleted with gold or helmed with bronze;<br>
    Higher her eyes from crown to loftier crown<br>
    Creep, till they fall, nigh-blasted, at the frown<br>
Of Argos, throned in his pavilions<br><br>

And mid his captains wrathfully aware<br>
    How the plague smites the host, how by the sea<br>
Beyond the ships, with vengeful prayer and oath,<br>
Rages the young Achilles, of whose wrath<br>
    Innocent, ignorant, a captive, she<br>
Sees but the dropped staff on the voided chair.</blockquote><br>

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Miscellany of Poetry, by Various

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MISCELLANY OF POETRY ***

This file should be named 8mspt10h.htm or 8mspt10h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, 8mspt11h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 8mspt10ah.htm

Produced by Clytie Siddall, Keren Vergon
and the online Distributed Proofreading Team!

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this eBook,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     eBook or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this eBook in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          eBook in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the eBook refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
